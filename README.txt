# NaiveBayes_Classifier
A Naive Bayes Classifier that takes in 2 files as input: a testing.txt and training.txt that contains data on game reviews along with their ratings. 

mp1.cpp is a program organizes information from training.txt to classify whether a review in the testing.txt is positive(1) or negative(0). This program outputs
the label of each review and at the end of the program and outputs the time it took to train and test the program along with the accuracy of this program
on the training and testing sets. 

Modify stopwords.txt with words that are irrelevant to determining whether a review is positive or negative to help filter out noise that could affect accuracy. 

testing.txt and training.txt are datasets provided by UCSB cs165a.
